Two-Million-Regressions-Python
This repository contains a Python-based replication of Xavier Sala-i-Martin’s influential 1997 paper “I Just Ran Two Million Regressions”, published in the American Economic Review. Completed as part of a university assignment, the goal of this project was to replicate the paper’s logic and empirical approach "in spirit" using Python in Google Colab. The assignment focused on identifying robust determinants of long-run economic growth through systematic regression analysis.

The original dataset used in the paper, available from Sala-i-Martin’s Columbia University website, includes cross-country variables observed primarily around 1960–1990. These variables reflect a wide range of theoretical perspectives, covering topics such as capital accumulation, education, geography, trade openness, political stability, and institutional quality. Following the assignment instructions, data cleaning involved retaining only those observations with non-missing values for the dependent variable (GDP growth) and the three fixed explanatory variables: log of GDP per capita in 1960, life expectancy in 1960, and primary school enrollment in 1960.

The project began with the calculation of descriptive statistics for the main variables of interest. After that, a baseline regression was estimated using only the three fixed variables. Multiple additional regressions were then executed, each combining the fixed variables with different sets of candidate explanatory variables—reflecting the method used in Sala-i-Martin’s original framework. In total, at least ten distinct model specifications were run, ensuring that each of the core variables highlighted in Table 1 of the paper appeared in at least two regressions. The output included regression coefficients, standard errors, and indicators of statistical significance, allowing comparison of robustness across models.

All analysis was carried out using Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, statsmodels for regression analysis, and seaborn/matplotlib for visualizations. The resulting findings mirrored those reported by Sala-i-Martin: some variables, such as equipment investment, rule of law, number of years the economy was open, and absolute latitude, consistently showed strong and robust associations with economic growth. The results highlight the importance of examining the distribution of regression outcomes across multiple model specifications, rather than relying on isolated significance tests.

This project demonstrates how robust inference about growth determinants can be achieved through computational methods that explicitly confront model uncertainty. The approach balances theory with empirical evidence and reflects a more probabilistic view of econometric results, as advocated by Sala-i-Martin.
